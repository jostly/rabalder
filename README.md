Rabalder
========

Version 0.1 (alpha)

Rabalder is a Boulder Dash clone, aiming to remain true to the C64 original game as far as game mechanics and level layout are concerned. To that end, I found this page http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/peterb/ very useful. Thanks to those involved for putting it together.


This game was written as part of the One Game a Month challenge, http://www.onegameamonth.com




Building from source
--------------------

In order to build the game from these sources, you need

1. Scala 2.9.2 and SBT 0.12.1 or later, see http://typesafe.com/stack/download
2. libgdx 0.9.7 or later, see http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/

Unpack the libgdx zip and place the jar-files in lib/, see lib/README

Use the ```assembly``` task in SBT to assemble a jar-file with everything needed to run the game.
